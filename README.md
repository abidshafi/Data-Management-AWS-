# Data-Management-AWS-

### Bulletin Description of the Course
* This course provides a practical grounding in managing data for analytics work.
* We emphasize traditional and contemporary tools for data ingestion, wrangling, databases, and data warehousing, with a focus on schema design and dimensional modeling, and with substantial hands-on experience using these tools and other contemporary methods for managing and analyzing data at scale.
* We will focus on using these tools for the middle phases of data analysis: ingesting, wrangling, exploring, and modeling, with an emphasis on delivering reproducible data analyses. 
* This course is complementary to other foundational courses in the Business Analytics program; as such, topics and techniques from Statistics, Programming, Data Mining, and Optimization may be present as use cases.

### Course Learning Objectives
* Use cloud service platforms such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) for data management and analytics
* Develop theoretical foundation and practical experience working with a variety of traditional and contemporary data management tools, enabling students to work productively with any product or toolkit they might encounter
* Gain skills in ingesting, wrangling and exploring data with a variety of tools inside and outside of databases
* Gain skills in data modeling both relational and dimensional as well as schemaless databases
* Understand and be able to develop, deliver, and review reproducible data analyses


### Software
* Our primary computing environment is AWS EC2 (https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) with Jupyter (http://jupyter.org/), a web-based lab notebook system ideal for data management and analysis.
* We have prepared a server image (Amazon Machine Image or AMI) named "2021-dmfa-v2" (AMI id " ami-09280b0d8d142349a") for your use in class. This image should have all the software you need for the class, including Jupyter, Python, PostgreSQL, and Apache Spark, along with some extras like R, and text editor. Any updates to this image will be announced in class or via Blackboard.

You will have full control of your own server, but note the following:
* AWS use is not free. A certain limited amount of use is within the "free educational tier", but beyond this, you may need to create your own account and incur charges. Expected overall AWS cost for the course is zero.
* When you are not using your AWS-EC2 instance, shut it down. It will not incur charges while it is shut down.
* Using AWS EC2 is highly recommended. It is the only option supported by your instructor.
